              <strong>Dusan Borojevic</strong> started engaging in music at the
              age of 7. His first instrument was the accordion, although he
              always wanted to start with the guitar. After 2 to 3 years of
              attending accordion classes at the 'Josif Marinkovic' music school
              in Vrsac, he began learning the guitar (at the age of 10) at the
              same school. As the music theory and solfeggio teachers noticed
              his talent for singing, they encouraged him to pursue vocal
              training, so at the age of 16, he started taking solo singing
              lessons. Despite his love for classical music, which he perhaps
              values the most, after completing his education, he continues to
              focus on rock, pop, and blues genres.

            <p class="step-description">
              <strong>Metallica</strong> is an American heavy metal band formed
              in Los Angeles, California, in 1981. The band's lineup originally
              consisted of vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, drummer Lars
              Ulrich, guitarist Dave Mustaine, and bassist Ron McGovney.
              However, Mustaine was soon replaced by Kirk Hammett, and Cliff
              Burton took over on bass. <br /><br /><strong
                >"Nothing Else Matters"</strong
              >
              is one of Metallica's most iconic and enduring songs, released in
              1992 as the third single from their self-titled album, commonly
              referred to as the "Black Album." The song showcases a departure
              from the band's usual thrash metal style, featuring a more
              introspective and melodic sound. Written by vocalist/guitarist
              James Hetfield, "Nothing Else Matters" delves into themes of love,
              trust, and vulnerability. The song's lyrics express a deeply
              personal sentiment, reflecting Hetfield's struggles with being
              away from his then-girlfriend while on tour.
